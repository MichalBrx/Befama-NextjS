    "MW6": "The MW6 multi-chamber mixer is used for the precise preparation of the mixture of fibers made of several fiber components with a length not exceeding 80 mm. When creating a mixture of several raw materials, it is necessary to weigh them in advance and mix them initially.",
    "CR": "Carding sets for the production of yarn from wool fibers, its blends and regenerated fibers. Installed power depends on the working width and machine configuration.",
    "CS": "Machines are designed for carding wool and preparing it for further processing in the worsted or semi-worsted system. CSW611 and CSW641 - are intended for processing wool and a mixture of wool with synthetic fibers. CSP611 and CSP641 - are intended for the processing of synthetic fibers.",
    "CU611": "Single-doffer carding machines are designed for the production of low-grammage nonwovens, usually in the range of 40 - 200 g / m2. Installed power depends on the working width and machine configuration.",
    "CU661": "Double doffer carding machines are designed for the production of nonwovens of high grammage, usually in the range of 100 - 2000 g / m2. Installed power depends on the working width and machine configuration.",
    "CU121": "The CU121 carding set is used for processing test blends of different fibres and colours to select optimum carding parameters for different mixture ratios.The carding set, along with a crosslapper, needlepunching machine, calender or other machine, can be useful for developing new methods in research centres, institutes and other similar organizations.The carding set contains a 1E chute feeder of modern design, a 3KA card and a 5AZ web condensing rollers.",
    "3AGK": "The 3AGK is a carding machine specifically developed for clothing industry. It is suitable for making web used as base material for hat felt. A large main cylinder along with seven pairs of working/stripping rollers provide a precise opening and blending of fibres.",
    "5W50": "The 5W50-series lappers can work with non-woven carding machines of 1000, 1800, 2000, 2200 or 2500 mm working width. Lapping width according to the lapper type: from 600 to 4200 mm.
